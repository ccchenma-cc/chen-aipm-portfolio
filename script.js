    "mbti.overviewText": "MindPalace started from a very personal frustration: when I am emotionally confused, I usually look for empathy first. That helps, but it also means I keep hearing the kind of answer I already know how to receive. I wanted a small room where NT, NF, SJ, and SP could sit around the same question and make their differences visible.",

    "mbti.architectureText": "The product uses four MBTI cognitive dimensions instead of all 16 types, preserving the core difference in thinking styles while keeping the entry barrier low.

In a four-person product test, three users felt clearer or more certain after use, every user found at least one dimension relevant, and the SP perspective became a repeated surprise. The main improvement area is reducing the information density of the debate round.",
    "mbti.phase1Title": "Research the conversation model",
    "mbti.phase1Text": "Interviewed three people around emotional confusion, AI advice, and response preferences. The clearest signal was that people do not simply want an answer; they want a response style that matches or challenges their current state.",
    "mbti.phase2Title": "Define the product structure",

    "lumi.decision1": "Positioned Lumi Galaxy as an AI-native creative desktop-pet universe rather than a static showcase, giving each character its own personality, story hook, and interaction promise.",
    "lumi.decision2": "Used AI tools to accelerate character background writing, pixel-art asset drafts, dialogue tone, front-end prototyping, and visual iteration while keeping the creative direction coherent.",

    "lumi.strategyTitle": "Product strategy",
